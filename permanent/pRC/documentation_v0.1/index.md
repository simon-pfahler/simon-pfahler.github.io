# pRC - pretty Ressourceful tensor Calculations                   {#index}

pRC is a C++ library developed to efficiently perform calculations with high-dimensional tensors in the tensor train format. Using pRC's types, sizes of tensors (and thus tensor trains) are set at compile time, so no dynamic memory allocation is needed, increasing performance.

This documentation of pRC is currently being built.

Most of the documentation is done directly through explanation of the functions and classes (using structured code blocks before their definition).
Additionally, overview pages of the following aspects of pRC are available:
- [An overview of pRC classes](#pRCObjects)
- [Top-level value types](#ValueTypes)
- [Tensorish types](#TensorTypes)
- [Functors in pRC](#Functors)
